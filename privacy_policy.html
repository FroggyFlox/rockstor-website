              on our own servers, the following non-personal information: order id & name (eg 1234567890 & #2034), date of purchase, subscription
              length, discount code if used, appliance id, arbitrary computer name (if later entered in Appman), and renewal reminder sent status.
              However, to fulfill the function of sending the required activation code and later subscription renewal reminder, associated with our
              subscription service, we also store and use the email associated with each Shopify managed order as login id at our <a

              set upon login for their namesake purpose. All 3 are: non-tracking, first-party (set by this site), and required for this site's
              intended functions: and thus considered 'strictly necessary': <a

              Default web server logs are enabled. As such the potentially personally identifiable information of visiting client IP addresses, when
              combined with other information, as per the GDPR, is recorded in these logs. These logs are rotated periodically as per default OS
              settings and so this information is not kept indefinitely.

            <h4>Our Forum</h4>
            <p>
              Our "forum" subdomain uses the <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse" target="_blank" class="alert-link">Discourse</a> open
              source software and requires no cookies to operate if not logged in. Post login, there are only session cookies and non-personal
              persistent cookies that are non-tracking, first-party (set by the forum site itself) and required for the forum's core functions. The
              current list of default cookies, maintained by a Discourse co-founder, is detailed in the following <a
                href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/list-of-cookies-used-by-discourse/83690"
                target="_blank" class="alert-link">meta discourse forum thread</a>. Our instance of Discourse, in common with all our other sites,
              does not have Google Analytics (GA) enabled and runs no additional personalized content or ads; and so has no additional associated
              cookies or information sharing. All cookies are thus considered 'strictly necessary' for our forums core functions. <em>We also do not
              use forum emails for any non forum-related activity.</em> Also note that our "log anonymizer details" option is unset so as not to keep
              a user's details in the log after they are anonymized; as our part in our members' GDPR "Right to Erasure".
            <p>Requests for erasure should be directed, via forum private message (PM), to a moderator or above forum members. We are required, via
              the GDPR, to keep these PM erasure requests by way of documenting this erasure process. Background reference: <a
                  href="https://www.discoursehosting.com/kb/your-discourse-forum-and-the-gdpr/" target="_blank" class="alert-link">Your Discourse
                forum and the GDPR</a>.</p>
            <p>Please note: Discourse (our forum software) stores the following information: pages visited, IP, incoming & outgoing links, reading
              times per post, and user profiles viewed. Additionally for account holders: likes given, requested flags, registration IP, email,
              username, and optionally a "full name". All information associated with our forum is used exclusively for the forum's core functions, as
              detailed above. As such, and given we link to this privacy policy during forum signup, and given the below legal basis for collecting
              the associated personally identifiable information (email & IP address) our forum sign-up is consent-free with this privacy policy
              serving as our means of informing prospective forum members of what we collect, why, and what we do with it.</p>
