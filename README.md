# History
This website was initially developed using a Python based static site generator believed to be [hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde).
Things happened and likely required modifications out grew the generator and we are now left with a semi machine generated mess.
The plan, in time, is to transition to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) ([Syna](https://themes.gohugo.io/syna/) theme) and add French & European Portuguese etc translations.
But we must first publish what we have and go from here to include our website development in our community endeavours.

If you are game to offer any translations then please be patient while we transition to Hugo.
