The Rockstor Project, an open source community endeavour, is fostered by 2 discrete but co-operating entities:

Rockstor, Inc. (US): run by project founder Suman Chakravartula - Domain and [trademarks]({{< ref legal.md >}}) owner/admin.

Sole trader (UK): Philip Paul Guyton - Current maintainer, project lead, packager, distributor, and subscription shop owner/admin.

Shop/subscription proceeds, and donations, are backed by [Triodos](https://www.triodos.co.uk/) ethical & sustainable banking via a [Social Venture Current Account](https://www.triodos.co.uk/current-accounts/business-current-account).
For distribution and our main website we use the "rockstor" domain.
For support we use additionally the linuxlines/yewtreeapps domains.
We hope to rationalise these 'mixed' domains as we work towards sustainable Open Source development.

## Our Endeavour
---
To develop, maintain, and distribute an easy to use, flexible, Linux & BTRFS based DIY software appliance solution.

**Open source and community focused.** We develop on GitHub in collaboration with our users,

our community, and anyone who wants to help.

**Docker based Rock-on Extensibility.** Easy to roll your own and then contribute it back to the community.

**Simplicity & Usability.** Simple clear and intuitive user interface for what most folks do, most of the time.

**DIY Personal storage.** Provides 'private cloud' storage to all your networked devices.

Privacy, security, and freedom.

**Simple Storage done Sustainably.**
