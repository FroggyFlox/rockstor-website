## Our "Built on openSUSE" Installer EULA
The following is a Trademarks search/replace of our upstream (openSUSE) GPLv2 license.
And is the same as that displayed / agreed-to during our [kiwi-ng](https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi) created installer.
See the following file in our [rockstor-installer](https://github.com/rockstor/rockstor-installer/blob/master/config.sh) repository.

As indicated in [openSUSE:Trademark guidelines](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines) we are required to make these changes.
We are also required to use one of the given terms when referencing our upstream: we have chosen to use: **Built on openSUSE** & **Uses openSUSE**.
Examples of this use during the installer can be seen in our [Rockstor’s “Built on openSUSE” installer](https://rockstor.com/docs/installation/installer-howto.html) document section.

We thank openSUSE / SuSE and the wider open source community for such excellent resources as the Leap base OS we use, [kiwk-ng](https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi), and the [Open Build Service (OBS)](https://build.opensuse.org/).
