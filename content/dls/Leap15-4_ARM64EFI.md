**Note:** *Btrfs parity raid levels (5&6) are read-only by default.*

Awaiting Custom Ten64 drivers (may not be required any longer).
Consider our [Installing the Stable Kernel Backport](https://rockstor.com/docs/howtos/stable_kernel_backport.html)
to enable parity raid read-write access and for improved hardware compatibility.
**NOTE: backports how-to needs modifying for 15.4**
