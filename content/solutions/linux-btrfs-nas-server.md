Rockstor Traditional NAS Server is the recommended solution if you need a robust NAS server without bells and whistles.
It allows you to access centralized storage over the network (NAS).
While Linux has become the best platform for many things, with great filesystems, it has until recently lacked one like NetApp's WAFL or Sun's ZFS.
BTRFS is rapidly filling that void by offering many great features.

- Use the capabilities and amazing feature-set of BTRFS without being a seasoned Linux professional.
- Realize the full potential of BTRFS as a NAS file-system.

## Problem
It's not easy to build a BTRFS based NAS as it requires a lot of know how, scripting and advanced administration.

## Solution
Rockstor, the first Linux BTRFS NAS software appliance, aims to combine flexibility & ease-of-use.
Generic commodity hardware, both **X86_64 and ARM64 (e.g. Raspberyy Pi 4)**, can easily be up and running within minutes.
**Rockstor 4 is "Built on openSUSE"** while our near legacy 3 and older versions used CentOS 7 with newer elrepo kernels.
Once installed, all maintenance is done via Rockstor's Web-UI: good for NAS/linux beginners and pros alike.
