Rockstor Personal Cloud Server is a powerful local alternative to public cloud storage that mitigates the cost and risks of public cloud storage.
A lot of important data is stored on laptops, desktops, mobile devices, external hard-drives and various cloud storage services and the data footprint continues to increase as users generate and access more data.

### With Rockstor as your **Personal Cloud Server**, you can:

- Reduce cost of storing large amounts of data.
- Effectively scale capacity, manage privacy and performance.
- Access data from desktops, laptop or mobile devices from anywhere(inside and outside of your local network).
- Move data between public cloud, Rockstor and your devices.
- Protect data from theft, loss or unintentional access.

Personal Cloud Server is the recommended solution for prosumers with capacity, privacy and performance needs.
A lot of data is stored on laptops, desktops, mobile devices, external harddrives and various cloud storage services.
It becomes extremely difficult to effectively access data, manage privacy and security.
Important data can be lost, given open access unintentionally or deliberately stolen.
Aside from privacy and security concerns, it becomes considerably expensive to store large amounts of data on public cloud storage.
With increasing data footprint and many ways prosumers generate and access data, it is necessary to have a powerful local alternative to mitigate the cost and risks of public cloud storage.
With Rockstor as a Personal Cloud Server users can cost effectively store a lot of data, move data to and from public clouds and access data with various devices from within and outside their local network.

## Problem
A majority of prosumers store data in various locations inside the local network including NAS devices, external hard drives and usb drives.
Storing, sharing and even access to data becomes complicated and inefficient quickly.

## Solution
Rockstor provides not only the benefits of traditional NAS server, but also the benefits of cloud storage.
It can be installed on commodity hardware giving prosumers the flexibility to build their personal cloud on anything from an old laptop, a Hypervisor, a mini ATX box or a high performance server.
The result is a Personal Cloud Server that can be accessed from various devices securely within and outside the local network.
It also can be linked with public cloud storage .

## Problem
Public cloud storage is extremely convenient and empowering.
But at the same time there is a high privacy and security risk involved with storing certain data. 

## Solution
Rockstor can be linked to various public cloud storage offerings empowering users to move data between them.
Data can then be selectively hosted from whereever is appropriate.
It is just as easy and convenient to access and share your data from the personal cloud.
However, you have enhanced privacy, security and complete ownership of data on your personal cloud.

{{< ps phrase="Control your costs" >}}
## Problem
Cloud storage services start out cheap but could become prohibitively expensive as more data is stored.
Depending on factors outside your control, performance can be unreliable. 

## Solution
Rockstor is freely distributed and can be installed on hardware of your choice giving you complete control of cost of ownership based on your capacity and other requirements.
There are very few factors outside your control that effect cost and performance.
Capacity and performance can be scaled at any time.
