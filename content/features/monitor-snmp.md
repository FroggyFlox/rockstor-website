In addition to our Netdata Rock-on we have a build in Dashboard for top-level stats.

Rockstor's dashboard has customizable widgets for storage capacity, network, CPU and memory utilization.
SNMP is also supported to monitor Rockstor using other monitoring options.
And of course we have a Netdata Rock-on.
