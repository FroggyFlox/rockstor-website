Rockstor supports all popular file sharing protocols including Samba, NFS, and SFTP.
Samba (SMB) is excellent and the recommended protocol for desktop/laptop and Mac devices, with special Time Machine backup capability.
In addition to these protocols, mobile devices have access using Rock-ons.
For more advanced scenarios, NFS and SFTP are also supported.
